Z-Spread Statistics:
  • AAPL (high grade): 10-25 bps
  • DIS (entertainment): 11-110 bps
  • F (auto finance): 50-100 bps
  • Negative spreads for callable bonds (expected)

Part C - Z-Spread Validation:
  • Validated 3 sample bonds from different issuers
  • Re-pricing with z-spreads matches market perfectly
  • Precision: < 1e-6

Part D - Duration and Convexity:

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS AND INSIGHTS
================================================================================

YIELD CURVE ANALYSIS:
  • Slight inversion at short end (2-3Y)
  • Mid-curve rates lowest around 5-7Y (4.43-4.47%)
  • Long end slightly higher (4.55% at 30Y)
  • Curve shape consistent with April 2024 market conditions

CREDIT SPREAD ANALYSIS:
  • Investment-grade corporates (AAPL): Tight spreads (10-25 bps)
  • Entertainment sector (DIS): Moderate spreads (11-110 bps)
  • Auto finance (F): Wider spreads (50-100 bps)
  • Spreads widen with maturity (term structure of credit risk)

DURATION PATTERNS:
  • Corporate bonds show higher duration than treasuries (same maturity)
  • Callable bonds have reduced duration
  • Long-dated bonds (20Y+) show significant convexity

ISSUER ANALYSIS:
  • AAPL: Lowest spreads, highest credit quality
  • DIS: Moderate spreads, entertainment sector premium
  • F: Highest spreads, auto finance sector risk
  • VZ: Telecom sector, moderate spreads
